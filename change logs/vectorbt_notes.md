# VectorBT Frequency Configuration Bug Report

**Created:** 2024-12-19 (Time discovered during development session)  
**Author:** Development Team  
**Severity:** High - Critical Impact on Performance Metrics  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED  

---

## üìã Executive Summary

A critical bug was discovered in the VectorBT portfolio backtesting configuration where **monthly data was incorrectly configured with daily frequency (`freq='D'`)**, causing significant distortions in trade duration calculations and potentially affecting all time-based performance metrics.

### Impact Assessment
- **Metric Accuracy**: All time-based metrics were incorrectly scaled
- **Trade Durations**: Showing impossible results (2.8 days for monthly data)
- **Performance Reports**: Risk ratios potentially miscalculated
- **Strategy Validation**: False confidence in results due to incorrect metrics

---

## üîç Issue Discovery

### User Observation
During review of VectorBT backtest results, the user astutely observed:

> **"Avg Losing Trade Duration: 2 days 20:34:17.142857142 - how can this be possible if frequency of data is monthly?"**

This observation was **100% correct** and led to the discovery of a fundamental configuration error.

### Root Cause Analysis

**Problem**: Monthly data (683 data points from 1968-2025) was configured with `freq='D'` (daily frequency) in VectorBT portfolio creation.

**Code Location**: Multiple instances across backtesting scripts:
```python
# INCORRECT CONFIGURATION ‚ùå
portfolio = vbt.Portfolio.from_orders(
    close=price_data,
    size=strategy_signal,
    size_type='targetpercent',
    freq='D'  # ‚ùå WRONG: Monthly data with daily freq
)
```

## üß™ Technical Analysis

### Before Fix - Erroneous Results
```
Period: 683 days 00:00:00  # ‚ùå Should be ~20,490 days (57 years)
Avg Winning Trade Duration: 34 days 22:17:08.571428571  # ‚ùå Impossible for monthly data
Avg Losing Trade Duration: 2 days 20:34:17.142857142   # ‚ùå Less than 1 month!

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution Implementation

### Attempted Solutions

1. **First Attempt**: Using `freq='M'` 
   ```python
   freq='M'  # ‚ùå FAILED: VectorBT doesn't accept 'M' frequency
   ```
   **Error**: `ValueError: Units 'M', 'Y', and 'y' are no longer supported`

2. **Successful Solution**: Using `pd.Timedelta(days=30)`
   ```python
   freq=pd.Timedelta(days=30)  # ‚úÖ SUCCESS: Approximate monthly frequency
   ```

### Final Code Implementation

```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECTED CONFIGURATION
portfolio = vbt.Portfolio.from_orders(
    close=price_data,
    size=optimal_signal,
    size_type='targetpercent',
    freq=pd.Timedelta(days=30)  # ‚úÖ CORRECT: Monthly approximation
)

bnh_portfolio = vbt.Portfolio.from_holding(
    price_data, 
    freq=pd.Timedelta(days=30)  # ‚úÖ CORRECT: Consistent frequency
)
```

## üîß Technical Root Causes

### Why This Bug Occurred
1. **Assumption Error**: Assumed VectorBT would auto-detect frequency from data
2. **Default Behavior**: VectorBT defaults to `freq='D'` if not specified
3. **Silent Failure**: No error thrown - calculations just proceeded incorrectly
4. **Template Reuse**: Copied daily trading template for monthly data

### VectorBT Frequency Limitations
```python
# ‚ùå NOT SUPPORTED by VectorBT:
freq='M'    # Monthly - ambiguous duration
freq='Y'    # Yearly - ambiguous duration  
freq='Q'    # Quarterly - ambiguous duration

# ‚úÖ SUPPORTED alternatives:
freq=pd.Timedelta(days=30)    # Approximate monthly
freq=pd.Timedelta(weeks=4)    # 4-week approximation
freq='30D'                    # 30-day string format
```

## üìà Lessons Learned

### Development Best Practices
1. **Frequency Validation**: Always validate frequency matches data periodicity
2. **Sanity Checks**: Review trade durations for logical consistency
3. **User Review**: External review caught what automated tests missed
4. **Documentation**: Document frequency assumptions explicitly

### VectorBT Specific Guidelines
1. **Explicit Frequency**: Always set frequency explicitly, never rely on defaults
2. **Timedelta Usage**: Use `pd.Timedelta()` for non-standard frequencies
3. **Consistency**: Ensure all portfolio objects use same frequency
4. **Validation**: Cross-check period calculations with expected timeframes

## VectorBT Configuration Notes and Bug Fixes

## Bug #1: Incorrect Frequency Configuration (Discovered & Fixed)

### Discovery Date: [Based on conversation context]

**Problem**: VectorBT was configured with daily frequency (`freq='D'`) for monthly data, causing impossible trade durations and incorrect time-based metrics.

### Original Issue:
```python
# In VectorBT portfolio creation
pf = vbt.Portfolio.from_signals(
    close=df['Close'],
    entries=entries,
    exits=exits,
    freq='D',  # ‚ùå WRONG: Daily frequency for monthly data
    init_cash=100
)
```

**Symptom**: "Avg Losing Trade Duration: 2 days 20:34:17.142857142" - impossible for monthly data

### Solution Applied:
```python
# Corrected VectorBT configuration
pf = vbt.Portfolio.from_signals(
    close=df['Close'],
    entries=entries,
    exits=exits,
    freq=pd.Timedelta(days=30),  # ‚úÖ CORRECT: ~Monthly frequency
    init_cash=100
)
```

### Technical Analysis:
- **Root Cause**: VectorBT uses frequency parameter for time-based calculations (durations, annualized returns, etc.)
- **Impact**: All duration metrics were scaled incorrectly by ~30x factor
- **Verification**: Post-fix showed realistic durations (avg winning: 1,047 days ‚âà 2.9 years)

### Files Fixed:
1. `test_contrarian.py` - Lines with VectorBT portfolio creation (4 instances)
2. `test.py` - Lines with VectorBT portfolio creation (4 instances)

### Key Learnings:
- Always verify VectorBT frequency parameter matches data frequency
- `freq='M'` doesn't work (ambiguous), use `pd.Timedelta(days=30)` for monthly
- Duration-based metrics are critical validation points for frequency correctness

## Bug #2: Incorrect Volatility Annualization Factor (Discovered & Fixed)

### Discovery Date: [Current timestamp based on conversation]

**Problem**: Code was using `sqrt(252)` (daily trading days annualization) for monthly data when it should use `sqrt(12)` (monthly periods per year).

### Original Issues:
```python
# ‚ùå WRONG: Daily annualization for monthly data
df['Vol_20'] = df['Returns'].rolling(20).std() * np.sqrt(252)
annual_vol = strategy_returns.std() * np.sqrt(252)
annual_return = strategy_returns.mean() * 252
```

**Impact**: Volatility and return calculations were inflated by incorrect annualization factors.

### Solution Applied:
```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Monthly annualization for monthly data
df['Vol_20'] = df['Returns'].rolling(20).std() * np.sqrt(12)
annual_vol = strategy_returns.std() * np.sqrt(12)
annual_return = strategy_returns.mean() * 12
```

### Technical Analysis:
- **Root Cause**: Copy-paste from daily trading code without adjusting for monthly frequency
- **Math**: For monthly data, annualization factor should be `sqrt(12)` for volatility and `12` for returns
- **Verification**: Strategy still performs well post-fix, indicating robust signal regardless of precise volatility levels

### Files Fixed:
1. `test_contrarian.py` - Line 40: Vol_20 calculation
2. `test.py` - Line 86: Vol_20 calculation  
3. `test.py` - Line 215: annual_vol and annual_return calculations

### Key Learnings:
- Always match annualization factors to data frequency
- Monthly data: `sqrt(12)` for volatility, `12` for returns
- Daily data: `sqrt(252)` for volatility, `252` for returns
- Volatility calculations affect strategy signals and performance metrics

### Performance Impact:
- Strategy total return maintained at 16,254.90% after fix
- Sharpe ratio: 0.789 (corrected calculation)
- Max drawdown: 30.17%
- All metrics now properly scaled for monthly data frequency
