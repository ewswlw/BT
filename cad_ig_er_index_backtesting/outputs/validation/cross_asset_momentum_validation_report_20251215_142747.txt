COMPREHENSIVE VALIDATION REPORT
Strategy: CROSS_ASSET_MOMENTUM
Generated: 20251215_142747
====================================================================================================

This report provides a comprehensive validation analysis based on the methodologies
outlined in 'Advances in Financial Machine Learning' by Marcos López de Prado.

The validation framework addresses common pitfalls in backtesting including:
  - Data leakage and look-ahead bias
  - Multiple testing and selection bias
  - Overfitting detection
  - Non-IID data handling
  - Robustness assessment

====================================================================================================

SECTION 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall Validation Status: FAIL
Risk Level: HIGH

KEY FINDINGS:
--------------------------------------------------
  • Deflated Sharpe Ratio: 0.0000 (FAIL)
  • Minimum Backtest Length Met: NO
    Required: 10741 periods
    Current: 5833 periods

RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
  ⚠ CRITICAL: Low deflated Sharpe ratio (< 0.80)

====================================================================================================

SECTION 8: DATA QUALITY VALIDATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DATA QUALITY METRICS:
--------------------------------------------------
Completeness: 100.00%
Number of Samples: 5833
Number of Features: 5
Missing Values: 0

====================================================================================================

SECTION 2: CROSS-VALIDATION ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No cross-validation results available.

SECTION 5: SAMPLE WEIGHTING ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SAMPLE WEIGHT STATISTICS:
--------------------------------------------------
Mean Weight: 1.000000
Std Weight:  0.026067
Min Weight:  0.999400
Max Weight:  2.716227

LABEL UNIQUENESS:
--------------------------------------------------
Mean Uniqueness: 0.1251
Min Uniqueness:  0.1250

Uniqueness measures how much each label overlaps with others.
Values closer to 1.0 indicate less overlap (more unique labels).

Overlapping Labels Detected: 40803

WHY SAMPLE WEIGHTS MATTER:
--------------------------------------------------
Financial data violates the IID (Independent and Identically Distributed)
assumption. Labels often overlap in time, creating dependencies.

PROBLEM:
  • Standard ML assumes independent samples
  • Overlapping labels violate this assumption
  • This leads to overfitting and poor generalization

SOLUTION:
  • Weight samples by their uniqueness
  • More unique labels get higher weights
  • This accounts for the non-IID nature of financial data

HOW TO INTERPRET:
--------------------------------------------------
✓ LOW VARIATION: Relatively uniform weights.
  Few overlapping labels detected.

====================================================================================================

SECTION 3: DEFLATED PERFORMANCE METRICS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DEFLATED SHARPE RATIO:
--------------------------------------------------
Estimated Sharpe Ratio: 0.8899
Number of Trials: 100
Deflated Sharpe Ratio: 0.0000

WHAT IS DEFLATED SHARPE RATIO?
--------------------------------------------------
The Deflated Sharpe Ratio (DSR) adjusts the estimated Sharpe ratio to account
for MULTIPLE TESTING BIAS. When you test many strategies, you're likely to
find one that performs well purely by chance.

FORMULA:
  DSR = Φ((SR - E[SR_max]) / √Var[SR_max])

Where:
  • SR = Your estimated Sharpe ratio
  • E[SR_max] = Expected maximum Sharpe ratio under null hypothesis
  • Var[SR_max] = Variance of Sharpe ratio
  • Φ = Standard normal CDF

The DSR tells you the PROBABILITY that your Sharpe ratio is genuine,
not just the result of multiple testing.

HOW TO INTERPRET:
--------------------------------------------------
✗ POOR: 0.0% confidence this is not a false positive.
  High risk of false discovery. Do not trade this strategy.
  Consider:
    - Testing on more data
    - Reducing number of parameter combinations tested
    - Using more conservative significance levels

PROBABILISTIC SHARPE RATIO:
--------------------------------------------------
PSR Value: 1.0000

WHAT IS PROBABILISTIC SHARPE RATIO?
--------------------------------------------------
PSR computes the probability that your estimated Sharpe ratio exceeds
a benchmark (typically 0 or 1.0). Unlike standard Sharpe, PSR accounts
for the distribution's skewness and kurtosis.

HOW TO INTERPRET:
--------------------------------------------------
✓ EXCELLENT: Very high probability (>95%) that SR exceeds benchmark.

====================================================================================================

SECTION 6: WALK-FORWARD ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Walk-forward analysis not performed.

SECTION 4: OVERFITTING DETECTION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Probability of Backtest Overfitting (PBO) not calculated.
PBO requires testing multiple strategy configurations.

SECTION 7: MINIMUM BACKTEST LENGTH ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MINIMUM BACKTEST LENGTH REQUIREMENT:
--------------------------------------------------
Required Length: 10741 periods
Current Length:  5833 periods
Adequacy Status: ✗ INADEQUATE

WHAT IS MINIMUM BACKTEST LENGTH?
--------------------------------------------------
López de Prado provides a formula for the minimum backtest length needed
to have confidence in your results:

  MinBTL = ((SR* / SR)^2 - 1) × N

Where:
  • SR* = Target Sharpe ratio
  • SR = Expected Sharpe ratio
  • N = Number of observations in original backtest

This ensures you have enough data to distinguish genuine edge from noise.

HOW TO INTERPRET:
--------------------------------------------------
✗ INADEQUATE: You need more data for reliable backtesting.
  Shortfall: 4908 periods
  Recommendations:
    - Wait for more data
    - Use lower frequency data (e.g., weekly instead of daily)
    - Reduce target Sharpe ratio expectations

====================================================================================================

SECTION 9: DETAILED METRIC EXPLANATIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section provides detailed explanations of all validation metrics used in this report.

====================================================================================================

1. DEFLATED SHARPE RATIO (DSR)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IT IS:
  The Deflated Sharpe Ratio adjusts your estimated Sharpe ratio to account for
  multiple testing bias. When testing many strategies, you're likely to find
  one that performs well by chance alone.

WHY IT MATTERS:
  Without adjustment, you may think you found a great strategy when you actually
  just got lucky after testing many variations.

HOW TO READ IT:
  • DSR > 0.95: Excellent - Very high confidence this is genuine
  • DSR 0.80-0.95: Moderate - Good confidence, proceed with caution
  • DSR < 0.80: Poor - High risk of false discovery, do not trade

INDUSTRY BENCHMARK:
  Institutional strategies typically require DSR > 0.95 before deployment.

====================================================================================================

2. PROBABILITY OF BACKTEST OVERFITTING (PBO)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IT IS:
  PBO measures the probability that your backtest results are due to overfitting
  rather than genuine predictive power. It compares in-sample vs out-of-sample
  performance.

WHY IT MATTERS:
  A strategy that works in-sample but fails out-of-sample is overfit and will
  fail in live trading.

HOW TO READ IT:
  • PBO < 0.30: Low risk - Strategy likely genuine
  • PBO 0.30-0.70: Moderate risk - Proceed with caution
  • PBO > 0.70: High risk - Do not trade, likely overfit

RED FLAGS:
  • Large gap between IS and OOS performance
  • Best IS configuration performs poorly on OOS
  • PBO > 0.70

====================================================================================================

3. PURGED CROSS-VALIDATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IT IS:
  Standard cross-validation fails in finance because labels overlap in time.
  Purged CV removes training samples that overlap with test samples, preventing
  data leakage.

WHY IT MATTERS:
  Without purging, you're using future information to predict the past, which
  creates look-ahead bias.

KEY COMPONENTS:
  • PURGING: Remove overlapping samples
  • EMBARGO: Add buffer period after test set
  • TIME-AWARE: Respects temporal order

HOW TO READ IT:
  • Low CV std: Consistent performance across folds (good)
  • High CV std: High variation, possible overfitting (bad)

====================================================================================================

4. SAMPLE WEIGHTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IT IS:
  Financial labels often overlap in time, violating the IID assumption.
  Sample weights adjust for this by giving more weight to unique labels.

WHY IT MATTERS:
  Ignoring overlapping labels leads to overfitting and poor generalization.

TYPES:
  • UNIQUENESS WEIGHTS: Based on label overlap
  • TIME DECAY WEIGHTS: More recent samples weighted higher
  • SEQUENTIAL BOOTSTRAP: Accounts for dependencies

HOW TO READ IT:
  • High weight variation: Many overlapping labels, weighting critical
  • Low weight variation: Few overlaps, standard ML may work

====================================================================================================

5. WALK-FORWARD ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IT IS:
  Simulates real trading by training on past data and testing on future data,
  then moving forward in time.

WHY IT MATTERS:
  This is how you actually trade - you only know past data when making decisions.

TYPES:
  • EXPANDING: Training set grows over time
  • ROLLING: Fixed-size window that moves forward

HOW TO READ IT:
  • Stable performance: Strategy robust over time
  • Variable performance: Strategy may be regime-dependent

====================================================================================================

6. MINIMUM BACKTEST LENGTH
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IT IS:
  The minimum amount of data needed to have confidence in backtest results.

WHY IT MATTERS:
  Too little data means you can't distinguish signal from noise.

HOW TO READ IT:
  • Adequate: You have enough data
  • Inadequate: Need more data or lower expectations

====================================================================================================

7. PROBABILISTIC SHARPE RATIO (PSR)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IT IS:
  PSR computes the probability that your Sharpe ratio exceeds a benchmark,
  accounting for skewness and kurtosis.

WHY IT MATTERS:
  Standard Sharpe assumes normal returns, which is rarely true in finance.

HOW TO READ IT:
  • PSR > 0.95: Very high probability SR exceeds benchmark
  • PSR 0.80-0.95: Good probability
  • PSR < 0.80: Low probability

====================================================================================================

GENERAL VALIDATION BEST PRACTICES:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ALWAYS use purged cross-validation for financial data
2. ALWAYS calculate deflated Sharpe ratio when testing multiple strategies
3. ALWAYS check PBO before deploying a strategy
4. ALWAYS use sample weights for overlapping labels
5. ALWAYS perform walk-forward analysis
6. ALWAYS verify minimum backtest length
7. NEVER optimize on test set
8. NEVER ignore overlapping labels
9. NEVER trust a single backtest result
10. ALWAYS validate on actual strategy data (not synthetic)

====================================================================================================

SECTION 10: RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. MULTIPLE TESTING BIAS:
   • Low deflated Sharpe ratio
   • High risk of false discovery
   • Test on more data or reduce trials

5. DATA ADEQUACY:
   • Need 4908 more periods
   • Consider using lower frequency data
