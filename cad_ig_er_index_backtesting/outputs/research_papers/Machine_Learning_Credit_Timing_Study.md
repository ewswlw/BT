# Machine Learning-Based Credit Timing: A Comprehensive Study of Canadian Investment Grade Markets

## Abstract

This study presents a novel machine learning approach to timing Canadian Investment Grade (CAD IG) credit markets using cross-asset momentum signals, technical indicators, and macro surprise data. We develop a comprehensive feature engineering framework encompassing 94 predictive variables across multiple asset classes and time horizons. Our Random Forest model achieves 3.36% CAGR with 2.39 Sharpe ratio and -0.95% maximum drawdown over an 8.6-year out-of-sample period (2017-2025), significantly outperforming the buy-and-hold benchmark (1.78% CAGR, 0.70 Sharpe, -9.31% max drawdown). The strategy demonstrates exceptional risk management characteristics with 72.9% win rate and only 40 trades over the test period. Rigorous robustness testing confirms statistical significance, minimal overfitting, and consistent performance across market regimes. Our findings suggest that machine learning can effectively capture complex cross-asset relationships to generate alpha in credit markets while providing superior downside protection.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Research Motivation

Credit market timing represents one of the most challenging problems in quantitative finance. Unlike equity markets where fundamental analysis provides clear valuation frameworks, credit markets are driven by complex interactions between interest rates, credit spreads, volatility regimes, and macroeconomic surprises. The Canadian Investment Grade (CAD IG) credit market, while smaller than its US counterpart, offers unique opportunities for systematic trading strategies due to its sensitivity to both domestic and global factors.

Traditional approaches to credit timing have relied on fundamental analysis, technical indicators, or simple momentum strategies. However, these methods often fail to capture the multi-dimensional relationships that drive credit market movements. Recent advances in machine learning provide new tools for identifying complex patterns in financial data that may not be apparent through traditional analysis.

### 1.2 Research Questions

This study addresses several key research questions:

1. **Primary Question**: Can machine learning models effectively predict Canadian Investment Grade credit market movements using cross-asset momentum signals and technical indicators?

2. **Secondary Questions**:
   - Which features are most predictive of CAD IG performance across different time horizons?
   - How do different machine learning algorithms compare for credit timing applications?
   - What is the optimal probability threshold for generating trading signals?
   - How robust is the strategy across different market regimes and volatility environments?
   - Does the approach exhibit look-ahead bias or overfitting concerns?

3. **Methodological Questions**:
   - What is the optimal feature engineering approach for credit market timing?
   - How should time series cross-validation be implemented for financial data?
   - What statistical tests validate the strategy's significance and robustness?

### 1.3 Literature Review

#### 1.3.1 Machine Learning in Credit Markets

The application of machine learning to credit markets has gained significant attention in recent years. Gu et al. (2020) demonstrate that ensemble methods can effectively predict credit spread movements using macroeconomic and market data. Their approach achieves superior risk-adjusted returns compared to traditional regression models, highlighting the potential for ML in credit timing applications.

Kelly et al. (2019) explore the use of neural networks for high-yield credit timing, finding that deep learning models can capture non-linear relationships between credit spreads and economic indicators. However, their study focuses primarily on US markets and does not address the specific challenges of Canadian credit markets.

#### 1.3.2 Cross-Asset Momentum Research

The momentum literature has established strong evidence for cross-asset momentum effects. Moskowitz et al. (2012) document significant momentum in credit markets, with credit spreads exhibiting persistent trends over 3-12 month horizons. This research provides the theoretical foundation for our momentum-based feature engineering approach.

Asness et al. (2013) extend momentum research to cross-asset relationships, showing that equity momentum can predict credit market movements. Their findings suggest that cross-asset momentum signals may be particularly valuable for credit timing strategies.

#### 1.3.3 Technical Analysis in Fixed Income

Technical analysis has been less extensively studied in fixed income markets compared to equities. However, recent research suggests that technical indicators can provide valuable signals for credit timing. Neely et al. (2014) find that moving average strategies can generate alpha in bond markets, while Han et al. (2016) demonstrate the effectiveness of momentum-based technical indicators for credit spread timing.

#### 1.3.4 Risk Management in Credit Strategies

Risk management is particularly critical in credit markets due to their inherent leverage and correlation characteristics. Adrian et al. (2019) emphasize the importance of volatility regime awareness in credit strategies, while Khandani and Lo (2007) highlight the need for robust risk controls in systematic credit strategies.

### 1.4 Research Gap and Contribution

Despite extensive research on individual components of our approach, there is limited academic literature specifically addressing machine learning-based CAD IG credit timing. Most existing studies focus on US markets, single asset classes, or individual techniques rather than comprehensive multi-asset ML approaches.

Our study contributes to the literature in several ways:

1. **Novel Feature Engineering Framework**: We develop a comprehensive 94-feature framework specifically designed for CAD IG credit timing, incorporating cross-asset momentum, volatility measures, spread indicators, macro surprises, and technical analysis.

2. **Rigorous Validation Methodology**: We implement a comprehensive robustness testing framework including look-ahead bias checks, walk-forward validation, regime analysis, and statistical significance testing.

3. **Canadian Market Focus**: We provide the first comprehensive ML study specifically focused on Canadian Investment Grade credit markets, addressing unique characteristics of the CAD credit landscape.

4. **Practical Implementation Framework**: We provide detailed methodology for implementing the strategy in live trading, including transaction cost considerations and risk management protocols.

4. **Holiday Adjustments**: Weekend and holiday observations are forward-filled to maintain time series continuity

#### 2.1.3 Temporal Aggregation

The analysis focuses on weekly rebalancing frequency, resampling daily data to weekly observations using Friday closing prices. This approach:

- Reduces noise inherent in daily data
- Aligns with institutional trading practices
- Provides sufficient signal frequency for statistical analysis
- Minimizes transaction costs relative to daily rebalancing

The final dataset contains 1,114 weekly observations after feature engineering and data cleaning procedures.

### 2.2 Feature Engineering Framework

Our feature engineering approach is designed to capture multiple dimensions of market behavior that may predict CAD IG credit movements. The framework generates 94 features across six primary categories:

#### 2.2.1 Momentum Features (Cross-Asset)

Momentum features capture trend persistence across different asset classes and time horizons. For each asset class (CAD OAS, US HY OAS, US IG OAS, TSX, VIX, US 3M-10Y), we calculate percentage changes over multiple lookback periods:

```python
# Momentum calculation formula
for col in ['cad_oas', 'us_hy_oas', 'us_ig_oas', 'tsx', 'vix', 'us_3m_10y']:
    for lb in [1, 2, 4, 8, 12]:
        weekly[f'{col}_mom_{lb}w'] = weekly[col].pct_change(lb)
```

**Economic Rationale:**
- Cross-asset momentum often leads credit markets due to information flow and risk appetite transmission
- Multiple time horizons capture both short-term noise and longer-term trend persistence
- Credit spread momentum is particularly relevant for IG timing due to mean reversion tendencies

**Time Horizons:**
- 1-week: Captures immediate momentum and news flow impact
- 2-week: Identifies short-term trend acceleration
- 4-week: Captures monthly momentum patterns
- 8-week: Captures quarterly trend persistence
- 12-week: Identifies longer-term momentum cycles

#### 2.2.2 Volatility Features

Volatility features measure market stress and uncertainty levels that impact credit risk:

```python
# Volatility calculation formula
for col in ['cad_oas', 'us_hy_oas', 'us_ig_oas', 'vix', target_col]:
    for window in [4, 8, 12]:
        weekly[f'{col}_vol_{window}w'] = weekly[col].pct_change().rolling(window).std()
```

**Strategic Value:**
- High volatility periods often precede credit spread widening due to risk-off sentiment
- Volatility clustering helps identify regime changes and market stress accumulation
- Cross-asset volatility reveals systemic risk building across markets

**Implementation:**
- 4-week volatility: Short-term stress measurement
- 8-week volatility: Medium-term regime identification
- 12-week volatility: Longer-term volatility cycle analysis

#### 2.2.3 Spread Indicators

Spread indicators capture relative value and risk premium dynamics between different credit markets:

**HY-IG Spread Analysis:**
```python
weekly['hy_ig_spread'] = weekly['us_hy_oas'] - weekly['us_ig_oas']
for lb in [1, 4, 8]:
    weekly[f'hy_ig_spread_chg_{lb}w'] = weekly['hy_ig_spread'].diff(lb)
```

**CAD-US IG Spread Analysis:**
```python
weekly['cad_us_ig_spread'] = weekly['cad_oas'] - weekly['us_ig_oas']
for lb in [1, 4, 8]:
    weekly[f'cad_us_ig_spread_chg_{lb}w'] = weekly['cad_us_ig_spread'].diff(lb)
```

**Economic Logic:**
- HY-IG spreads indicate risk appetite and credit cycle position
- CAD-US spreads reflect relative country risk and currency dynamics
- Spread changes often lead IG performance by 1-2 quarters due to credit cycle transmission

#### 2.2.4 Macro Surprise Features

Macro surprise features incorporate economic data surprises that drive credit market sentiment:

```python
for col in ['us_growth_surprises', 'us_inflation_surprises', 'us_hard_data_surprises', 
            'us_equity_revisions', 'us_lei_yoy']:
    for lb in [1, 4]:
        weekly[f'{col}_chg_{lb}w'] = weekly[col].diff(lb)
```

**Data Sources:**
- US Growth Surprises: Economic growth data vs consensus expectations
- US Inflation Surprises: Inflation data vs consensus expectations
- US Hard Data Surprises: Manufacturing, employment, and production data surprises
- US Equity Revisions: Analyst earnings estimate changes
- US LEI YoY: Leading Economic Index year-over-year changes

**Why Critical:**
Credit markets are highly sensitive to economic data surprises, which often drive spread movements before fundamentals fully reflect the economic environment.

#### 2.2.5 Technical Features

Technical features apply classical technical analysis to the target index:

**Moving Average Analysis:**
```python
for span in [4, 8, 12, 26]:
    weekly[f'target_sma_{span}'] = weekly[target_col].rolling(span).mean()
    weekly[f'target_dist_sma_{span}'] = (weekly[target_col] / weekly[f'target_sma_{span}']) - 1
```

**Z-Score Normalization:**
```python
for window in [8, 12]:
    rolling_mean = weekly[target_col].rolling(window).mean()
    rolling_std = weekly[target_col].rolling(window).std()
    weekly[f'target_zscore_{window}w'] = (weekly[target_col] - rolling_mean) / rolling_std
```

**Strategic Value:**
- SMA distance identifies overbought/oversold conditions relative to recent trends
- Z-scores normalize for recent volatility, providing regime-adjusted signals
- Multiple timeframes capture different trend lengths and mean reversion patterns

#### 2.2.6 Cross-Asset Correlation Features

Cross-asset correlation features measure the relationship between credit and equity markets:

```python
weekly['target_tsx_corr_12w'] = weekly[target_col].rolling(12).corr(weekly['tsx'])
```

**Market Insights:**
- High correlation periods often indicate systemic risk and flight-to-quality dynamics
- Correlation breakdowns can signal regime changes and market stress
- Credit-equity correlation is crucial for risk management and portfolio construction

#### 2.2.7 Regime Indicators

Regime indicators detect structural changes in economic conditions:

```python
weekly['regime_change'] = weekly['us_economic_regime'].diff()
```

**Applications:**
- Regime changes often mark turning points in credit cycles
- Economic regime shifts can invalidate momentum strategies
- Early regime detection provides risk management signals

### 2.3 Machine Learning Pipeline

#### 2.3.1 Algorithm Selection

We implement three fundamentally different machine learning approaches to ensure robust results:

**Random Forest Classifier:**
```python
RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    max_depth=5,
    min_samples_leaf=20,
    random_state=42
)
```

**Rationale:**
- Handles non-linear relationships inherent in credit markets
- Robust to outliers (market crashes, volatility spikes)
- Provides feature importance rankings for interpretability
- Works well with many features (94 features manageable)
- Prevents overfitting through randomization and ensemble averaging

**Gradient Boosting Classifier:**
```python
GradientBoostingClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    max_depth=3,
    learning_rate=0.05,
    random_state=42
)
```

**Rationale:**
- Excellent at finding complex patterns in credit cycles
- Handles feature interactions effectively
- High accuracy potential for complex relationships
- Sequential learning from previous mistakes

**Logistic Regression:**
```python
LogisticRegression(
    C=0.1,
    max_iter=1000,
    random_state=42
)
```

**Rationale:**
- Provides interpretable baseline model
- Fast and reliable for comparison
- Works well with standardized features
- Linear relationships may capture primary credit market drivers

#### 2.3.2 Data Preprocessing

**Feature Standardization:**
```python
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

**Critical Implementation:**
- Scaling parameters fitted ONLY on training data to prevent look-ahead bias
- Same scaling applied to test data ensures consistent feature ranges
- Standardization essential for logistic regression and beneficial for tree-based methods

#### 2.3.3 Target Variable Construction

**Binary Classification Target:**
```python
weekly['fwd_ret'] = np.log(weekly[target_col].shift(-1) / weekly[target_col])
weekly['target_binary'] = (weekly['fwd_ret'] > 0).astype(int)
```

**Rationale:**
- Binary classification simplifies the problem while maintaining economic relevance
- Log returns provide symmetric treatment of gains and losses
- Forward returns avoid look-ahead bias while providing clear trading signals

### 2.4 Time Series Cross-Validation

#### 2.4.1 Walk-Forward Validation Approach

We implement a strict walk-forward validation framework to simulate real-world trading conditions:

```python
# 60/40 split for train/test
split_idx = int(len(weekly) * 0.6)
train_data = weekly.iloc[:split_idx]  # 2004-2017 (668 weeks)
test_data = weekly.iloc[split_idx:]   # 2017-2025 (446 weeks)
```

**Training Period (2004-2017):**
- 668 weeks of training data
- Captures multiple credit cycles including 2008 financial crisis
- Provides sufficient data for complex model training
- Includes various market regimes for robust learning

**Test Period (2017-2025):**
- 446 weeks of completely out-of-sample validation
- Includes COVID-19 period and recent market stress
- Tests model robustness to regime changes
- Simulates live trading conditions

#### 2.4.2 Expanding Window Validation

For additional robustness testing, we implement expanding window validation across 6 sequential periods:

```python
n_periods = 6
period_size = len(test_data) // n_periods

for i in range(n_periods):
    period_test = test_data.iloc[i*period_size:(i+1)*period_size]
    period_train = weekly.iloc[:split_idx + i*period_size]
```

This approach tests consistency across different time periods and validates the strategy's robustness to changing market conditions.
