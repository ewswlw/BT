## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

### Limitations
- **Bear market dependency**: -1.86% CAGR during market stress
- **Model complexity**: High feature count relative to sample size
- **Transaction costs**: Not included in analysis
- **Market capacity**: CAD IG market size limitations

### Risk Management
- **Position sizing**: Adjust based on market regime
- **Stop-losses**: Implement during bear market periods
- **Regular recalibration**: Retrain every 3-6 months
- **Monitoring**: Track feature stability and performance

## üìà Practical Implementation

### Suitable Applications
- **Institutional portfolios**: Pension funds, insurance companies
- **Risk-averse strategies**: Capital preservation focus
- **Portfolio diversification**: Complement to equity strategies
- **Defensive alpha**: Steady returns with minimal risk

### Implementation Phases
1. **Validation** (Months 1-6): Pilot with modest position sizes
2. **Scaling** (Months 7-12): Increase allocation if validated
3. **Integration** (Year 2+): Full portfolio integration
