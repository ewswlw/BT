Stop Trusting Your Backtests (Until You’ve Fixed These 5 Errors)

-	Use robust validation methods like: Walk-Forward Optimization, Combinatorial Purged Cross-Validation (CPCV), Monte Carlo subsampling
-	one split is never enough
-	Backtests can lie. Especially when you optimize hyperparameters, tweak signals, or test multiple versions. 
-	✅ THE FIX
-	Run Walk-Forward tests
-	Try Monte Carlo resampling
-	Use sensitivity analysis on all key parameters
-	Test across multiple market conditions

Multi-Asset Feature Engineering in Financial ML

-	We need to account for price scale or volatility regime. Our model can’t possibly generalize if the same feature means “+0.5% signal” on one asset and “+10% trend” on another. Not all features are broken, but most aren’t plug-and-play
-	The fix? Stop feeding it absolute values. Start feeding it relationships.
-	Make it relative- Raw values lie. But ratios tell the truth. For example, instead of looking at the value of a KAMA or a volatility indicator we look at how it evolves relative to a slower version of itself. And it works.
✅ All assets now fluctuate around 0.
✅ Signals are bounded.
✅ Behavior is finally readable.
-	But one problem remains…Some features move wildly, others barely move. So even though both features are now centered, it’s still hard for the model to interpret them consistently.
-	Now it’s time to fix the scale. Apply a good old Z-score: Z = (x - μ) / σ. Each feature is now centered at 0, standardized with variance 1 and finally comparable across all assets. We’ve talked about Z-score, but you can also use a Min-Max scaler if you prefer your features bounded between 0 and 1. Want to make it more robust? Use the 1st and 99th percentiles instead of the true min/max, it protects you from outliers without breaking the scale
-	Always compute your scaling on the training set only. Then apply those same parameters to the test set. If you don’t, you’re leaking future information into your model. And that leads to artificially good performance and zero real-world reliability.

Guiding Principles
• Use group-wise (Kernel) PCA: one synthetic component per logical feature family (volatility, trend, regime …).
• Prevent information leakage by fitting scalers and PCA exclusively on the chronological training slice.
• Default to RBF-kernel KernelPCA; fall back to linear PCA if speed or sample constraints require it.
• Persist scaler parameters, PCA kernel choice, and component loadings for full reproducibility.


Do & Don’t Checklist
✅ Do  ❌ Don’t
Fit scaler and PCA on the training slice only      Mix future data into fitting objects
Log hyper-parameters and random seeds          Rely on silently changing defaults
Produce visual and statistical sanity checks after transformation        Assume the first component “just works”
Group features by their economic meaning before applying PCA           Dump every column into one giant PCA

Apply only where applicable:

-	Why Cross Validation? Time-series cross-validation is designed to estimate how well your model will generalize to unseen, future data, while respecting the chronological order of financial time series (so you never “peek” into the future).
-	Unlike random k-fold cross-validation (which shuffles data), time-series cross-validation splits your data into sequential “folds.”
-	Each fold uses only past data for training and future data for testing, mimicking a real-world forecasting scenario.
-	Financial and economic time series are not independent and identically distributed (IID); they have trends, cycles, and regime changes.
-	Using only past data to predict the future is realistic and avoids lookahead bias. This method reveals how model performance varies over time and across different market regimes.
-	For each fold, you get out-of-sample performance metrics (like R², RMSE, MAE, MDA). By looking at the average and standard deviation across all folds, you see not just how well the model can do, but also how stable and reliable it is.
-	Time-series cross-validation simulates “real-world” forecasting by always training on the past and testing on the future, across multiple rolling windows. This gives you a much more honest and robust assessment of your model’s predictive power, especially in financial applications where regime shifts and non-stationarity are common.
