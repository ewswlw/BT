# Issues With Gradient Boosting, Weekly Model on cad_ig_er_index

## Critical Data Snooping Issues

After examining the notebook in detail, I've identified several methodological issues that likely make the backtest results appear significantly better than they would be in reality:

### 1. Training and Testing on the Same Data

The model is trained and tested on the same dataset, which is a fundamental flaw in machine learning validation:

```python
pipe.fit(X, y)
proba = pd.Series(pipe.predict_proba(X)[:, 1], index=X.index)
```

This approach leads to severe overfitting as the model "sees" all the data it will be tested on. In a proper backtest, the model should only be trained on historical data and tested on out-of-sample future data.

### 2. Threshold Optimization Using Full Dataset

The code searches for the optimal threshold by testing multiple values against the entire dataset:

```python
for thr in thr_grid:
    sig = (proba > thr).astype(int)
    strat_ret = sig * data['ret1w'].shift(-1)
    equity = (1 + strat_ret.fillna(0)).cumprod()
    if best_equity is None or equity.iloc[-1] > best_equity.iloc[-1]:
        best_equity, best_thr = equity, thr
```

This creates significant look-ahead bias, as the threshold is optimized based on future results that would not be available in real trading.

### 3. No Walk-Forward Validation

The backtest does not implement any walk-forward testing or expanding window approach, which is essential for time series data. A robust approach would:
- Train on data up to time T
- Make predictions for time T+1
- Evaluate performance
- Expand the training window to include T+1
- Repeat

### 4. Feature Engineering Without Cross-Validation

Features are created and used without proper validation:

```python
# Momentum lags: 1â€“13 weeks
for k in (1, 2, 4, 8, 13):
    feat[f'ret_{k}'] = price_w.pct_change(k)

# Realized volatility: 4- & 8-week window
feat['vol_4'] = price_w.pct_change().rolling(4).std()
feat['vol_8'] = price_w.pct_change().rolling(8).std()
```

The specific lookback periods (1, 2, 4, 8, 13 weeks) may have been chosen based on knowledge of what worked in the full dataset, introducing selection bias.

### 5. No Consideration of Look-Ahead Bias in Signal Generation

The model generates signals using information that would not be available at the time of decision:

```python
strat_ret = sig * data['ret1w'].shift(-1)  # apply *next* week
```

While the code uses shift(-1) to properly align signals with future returns for backtesting purposes, there's no verification that the features themselves are properly lagged to avoid look-ahead bias.

## Unrealistic Performance Metrics

The resulting performance statistics are suspiciously good:
- 137.3% total return vs 31.7% benchmark return
- Win rate of 93.9% (extremely high for any trading strategy)
- Sharpe ratio of 3.3 (exceptional by industry standards)
- Max drawdown of only 0.54% (virtually unheard of in long-term trading)
- Profit factor of 200.56 (extraordinarily high)

These metrics would be exceptional even for the best institutional strategies, suggesting severe overfitting rather than a truly robust model.

## Missing Practical Considerations

### 1. No Transaction Costs

The backtest shows zero fees paid, which is unrealistic for any trading strategy, especially one that generates 115 trades:

```
Total Fees Paid                               0.0
```

### 2. No Slippage Modeling

There's no consideration for slippage or market impact, which can significantly reduce returns, especially for less liquid securities.

### 3. No Robustness Testing

The model doesn't include any sensitivity analysis to see how the strategy performs with different parameter settings, which is essential for determining if the results are robust or just a lucky combination of parameters.

## Recommendations for Improvement

To create a more realistic and robust backtest:

1. **Implement Proper Walk-Forward Testing**:
   - Split the data into training and testing periods
   - Use an expanding window approach for model training
   - Never use future data in any aspect of model training or parameter selection

2. **Add Cross-Validation for Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Optimize model hyperparameters (max_depth, n_estimators, learning_rate) using nested cross-validation
   - Select the signal threshold based only on training data

3. **Include Transaction Costs and Slippage**:
   - Add realistic transaction costs to each trade
   - Model slippage based on typical market conditions

4. **Test for Robustness**:
   - Vary model parameters to ensure results aren't dependent on specific settings
   - Test the strategy on different market regimes and time periods
   - Consider Monte Carlo simulations to assess risk

5. **Feature Engineering Discipline**:
   - Ensure all features are properly lagged to prevent look-ahead bias
   - Document the rationale for each feature before implementation
   - Test the contribution of each feature to overall performance

6. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Evaluate performance across different market conditions
   - Analyze drawdowns and recovery periods
   - Compare to multiple benchmarks and risk factors

Implementing these improvements would provide a much more realistic assessment of the strategy's potential real-world performance.
