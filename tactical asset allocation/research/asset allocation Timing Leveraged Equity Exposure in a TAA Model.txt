How a Simple VIX-based Filter Boosts Returns and Reduces Drawdown

Hi there,
Leveraged ETFs like SPXL and TQQQ are built to deliver a multiple of daily index retur
They can produce spectacular gains in trending markets, but are vulnerable to volatili
drag when conditions turn choppy. Because leverage is reset daily, compounding effec
accumulate over time, often leading to underperformance in volatile, mean-reverting
markets, but sometimes generating outsized returns in calm, trending markets.
Quantpedia recently highlighted this dynamic in their article Leveraged ETFs in Low-
Volatility Environments (drawing inspiration from Zarattini et al., 2025, on volatility-
based strategies), showing how a simple filter that compares realized and implied
volatility can improve the timing of leveraged equity exposure.
In this piece, I extend those insights by integrating a volatility filter, with some
modifications, into the Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA) model I’ve discussed before. The
goal is to better time allocations between leveraged equity (e.g., SPXL) and cash. The
results show meaningful improvements in CAGR, Sharpe ratios, and drawdowns.

Let’s dig into the details.
Background
Quantpedia’s article studies a simple volatility filter to improve the timing of leverag
equity exposure. The filter compares short-term realized volatility of the S&P 500 w
implied volatility derived from the VIX. When implied volatility exceeds realized
volatility, which is typically a sign of “normal” markets, the strategy allocates into
leveraged long equity (SPXL). Conversely, when realized volatility surpasses the VIX,
exposure is reduced or avoided.

In backtests spanning 2013–2025, Quantpedia finds that this approach improves bo
absolute and risk-adjusted performance, particularly when realized volatility is
measured with a longer window (e.g., 20 days) and the VIX is averaged over a short
horizon (e.g., 10 days). The resulting Sharpe and Calmar ratios demonstrate a notab
improvement over naive buy-and-hold exposure in leveraged ETFs.
The spread between implied and realized volatility is commonly referred to as the
volatility risk premium (VRP). On average, implied volatility tends to exceed realized
volatility, creating a premium that accrues to volatility sellers. However, this
relationship often inverts during periods of market stress. Such episodes are freque
associated with inversions of the VIX term structure, a topic I discussed here.
The chart below plots the difference between the VIX and 20-day realized volatility

The series is positive in 78% of observations, but marked by sharp negative spikes
during crises such as the COVID-19 selloff. Beyond these headline episodes, there a
also numerous smaller instances of stress when the VRP briefly turns negative.

Let’s now bring these insights into the Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA) model I’ve
discussed in earlier posts (see here and the subsequent robustness checks for detai
In its standard form, the TAA model uses SPY as the fallback asset. As a variation, I’v
instead in several posts also used leveraged equity ETFs such as SPXL or TQQQ in
order to boost long-run CAGR. However, as is well known, leveraged ETFs are
particularly vulnerable to volatility drag during turbulent, mean-reverting periods. T
makes them natural candidates for a volatility-based timing overlay.
The idea is simple: Use the volatility risk premium, the difference between implied a
realized volatility, to decide whether the fallback allocation should go into leveraged
equity or instead be held in cash. The only real parameter to set is the lookback
horizon used to compute the realized volatility of SPY. Following Quantpedia, and
consistent with the one-month horizon embedded in the VIX, I use a 20-day lookba
as the baseline.
The monthly rebalancing signals are then straightforward:
If realized volatility (20-day) < VIX → allocate fallback to SPXL
If realized volatility (20-day) > VIX → allocate fallback to cash
Allocations to the other assets in the model (TLT, GLD, DBC, UUP, BTAL) remain
unchanged. Only the fallback allocation toggles between leveraged equity and cash
depending on the VRP signal.
At each month-end rebalancing, I use only information available up to the previous
trading day, both in terms of returns and the VIX, to avoid lookahead bias. Transacti
costs are set at 5 basis points per trade. The study relies on daily ETF price data from
EODHD and VIX data from FirstRate Data.
The figures below report performance statistics for the strategy with and without th
VIX filter, along with plots of cumulative returns and drawdowns. For comparability,

both return series are scaled to a 10% annualized volatility.

Adding the VIX filter raises CAGR to above 25%, lifts the Sharpe ratio from 1.23 to 1
and reduces maximum drawdowns from 22% to roughly 16.5%. The drawdown-to-
volatility ratio improves notably, from 1.27 to 1.01. While the impact of the VIX filter
was most pronounced during the 2018 selloff, it also provided meaningful protectio
during several other periods.
On average, the VIX-filtered strategy allocates 4.6% of capital to cash, suggesting th
even modest shifts away from leveraged equity meaningfully improve the risk-retur
profile.
Robustness of Realized Vol Measure
A natural question is how sensitive the results are to the choice of lookback when
calculating realized volatility. To address this, I test windows ranging from 5 to 60
trading days in 5-day increments and report Sharpe ratios and drawdowns.

The evidence shows that applying the VIX filter improves both Sharpe ratios and
drawdowns across nearly all lookbacks. However, shorter horizons up to 20 days
deliver the strongest Sharpe ratios, suggesting a more reactive measure is preferred
practice, the precise choice of 10, 15, or 20 days is not critical; all capture the essenc
of the signal effectively.
Diversifying Across Vol Lookbacks
However, relying on a single realized volatility window can make the signal sensitive
noise or regime shifts. A simple way to reduce this dependence is to diversify across
multiple lookbacks, for example, 10, 15, and 20 days. Here is an example of a
straightforward allocation rule:
If RV of all lookbacks > VIX → allocate 100% of fallback to cash
If 2 lookbacks > VIX → allocate ⅔ to cash, ⅓ to SPXL
If 1 lookback > VIX → allocate ⅓ to cash, ⅔ to SPXL
If all lookbacks < VIX → allocate 100% to SPXL
This blended approach improves robustness while preserving the spirit of the filter.
backtests, it modestly enhances performance, lifting the Sharpe ratio to 1.41 and

reducing maximum drawdowns to around 15%.
Conclusion
My results indicate that a simple volatility filter, built on the spread between implied
and realized volatility, can substantially enhance leveraged equity allocations within
Tactical Asset Allocation framework. By cutting exposure when realized volatility
exceeds the VIX, the strategy sidesteps some of the most damaging drawdowns wh
still benefiting from the amplified upside of SPXL in calmer, trending markets.
For clarity, I have deliberately kept the signal construction simple to highlight the co
effect. That said, there is scope for refinement. More frequent rebalancing, the
inclusion of complementary distress indicators, or allowing the VIX filter to scale
allocations smoothly rather than through a binary on/off switch could further impro
results. These extensions will be part of my ongoing research.
Finally, for investors who already use TAA frameworks, adding a simple volatility filte
could be a low-effort enhancement to time equity exposure that improves risk-
adjusted returns without increasing model complexity.
