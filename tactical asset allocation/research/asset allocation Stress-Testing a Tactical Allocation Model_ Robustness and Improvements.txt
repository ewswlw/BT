Hi there,
Over the past weeks, I’ve received several thoughtful questions from subscribers about
the tactical allocation model I discussed earlier. Many of you asked about robustness:
What happens if we change the weighting scheme? What if we adjust the thresholds o
modify the defensive set of assets? Others wondered about possible improvements an
whether the strategy holds up across variations.
In today’s post, I’ll take a systematic look at these issues. My main takeaway upfront is
that the framework is surprisingly robust. Across weighting choices, signal specificatio
and parameter shifts, the model continues to deliver equity-like returns with far small
drawdowns than SPY. Still, there are interesting nuances worth highlighting.

Introduction
I won’t repeat the full details of the tactical allocation model here. If you’d like a
refresher, please see my earlier post where I outlined the mechanics. Instead, this
article focuses on robustness: How the model behaves when we vary key assumptio
such as weighting schemes, defensive thresholds, lookback windows, and fallback
rules. The goal is to stress-test the framework and see whether its performance hold
up across different specifications.
Weighting Schemes
The first dimension to test is how we combine the defensive assets. In the base versio
used rank-based weights as in the original paper, giving more weight to stronger
momentum signals. However, signals are noisy, and it’s not certain that allocating
more to larger but noisy signals is necessarily optimal. Two natural alternatives are
worth examining:

Equal-weighting the defensive set, where each qualifying asset gets the same
share.
Risk-weighting, or inverse-volatility weighting, where more capital is allocated t
lower-volatility defensives. I use a rolling 3-month volatility to determine weigh
The weighting alternatives only apply to the defensive bucket, whereas the equity
exposure, the fallback asset, simply receives the residual weight.
Running the model across rank weights, equal weights, and risk weights yields the
following results.

When we compare the three weighting schemes, the differences are subtle but
meaningful. Equal-weighting and inverse-volatility weighting delivered higher CAGR
(≈12.9%) than rank weighting (11%), primarily because they allocate more capital to
equities, on average, about 47% versus 30% under rank. That higher equity tilt bring
them closer to SPY, with correlations of 0.65 compared to just 0.29 for rank.
Rank weighting, in contrast, produces the lowest equity beta, the smallest max
drawdowns, and the most differentiated return stream. Interestingly, equal-weightin
and inverse-volatility weighting achieve the highest Sharpe ratios (1.26 and 1.30)
compared to 1.08 for rank. In practice, rank weighting may appeal to those explicitly
seeking a return stream that has low correlation to equities, while EW and IVOL tend
offer higher equity exposure, higher CAGR, and higher Sharpe ratios.
It’s comforting to see that equal-weighting, an even simpler construction than rank
based weights, produces a higher Sharpe ratio. By spreading capital evenly across t
defensives, the model achieves a Sharpe ratio of 1.26, outperforming the original ra
based scheme. This suggests that the robustness of the framework does not rely on
fine-tuned weightings, as even a naive allocation rule delivers strong risk-adjusted
returns.

Excluding Defensive Assets
The main idea of the model is to include defensive assets that are different in nature
with low correlation to each other, and which diversify equity risk in different ways.
Let’s check the performance impact of each specific defensive asset by excluding on
asset at a time.
The exclusion tests confirm that no single defensive asset dominates the strategy, a
performance holds up reasonably well even if one is removed. Most exclusions stay
close to the full model, though there are nuances:
Excluding GLD delivers a similar Sharpe as the full model with worse drawdown
suggesting gold is a valuable hedge when other assets fail.
Excluding DBC or UUP weakens results: CAGR falls to 9–10% and Sharpe drops
about 0.9. Both provide diversification in specific regimes (inflation shocks for
DBC, dollar bull runs for UUP), so their absence seems to hurt resilience.
Excluding BTAL leads to a bigger drawdown (–13%), confirming its role as an
equity hedge during downturns.
The full mix still looks strongest on balance, offering the best trade-off between
CAGR, drawdowns, and low correlation to SPY.
Overall, this exercise reinforces the point that robustness comes from combining
heterogeneous defensives as each asset contributes differently during the sample
period.

Transaction Costs
Some readers also asked about transaction costs. These are investor-specific, driven
trade size, venue, and execution quality. I assume a one-way cost of 5 bps in the ba
case, but I stress-test higher costs. As costs rise toward 25 bps, the strategy’s Sharpe
compresses and converges toward SPY’s.
Changing Defensive Threshold
While it is intuitive to use the risk-free rate as the hurdle for deciding whether an
asset’s momentum score justifies an allocation, it is worth asking how sensitive the
model is to that choice. To test this, I rerun the strategy with six fixed thresholds of 0
1%, 2%, 3%, 5%, and 7%, and compare them to the benchmark RF-based specificati
The results show that performance remains robust: Sharpe ratios and drawdowns ar
broadly stable across all thresholds, indicating that the model is not overly depende
on the precise choice of hurdle.
Excluding Lookback Windows
How sensitive is the model to the choice of lookbacks? In its current form, the strate
computes each defensive asset’s annualized return over 21, 63, 126, and 252 days a

averages the four. Below, I rerun the model while omitting one window at a time.
The results are reassuring: Performance is robust across all exclusions. Sharpe ratios
remain broadly similar from spec to spec, but they are consistently lower than the fu
specification. That gap suggests the full model benefits from diversifying across
horizons, blending short-, medium-, and long-term momentum improves efficiency
(higher Sharpe) and reduces drawdowns relative to any single-window subset.
Requiring Fallback Asset to Have Positive
Momentum
A thoughtful reader asked: “What if we only fall back to SPY if it also has positive
momentum?”
In the benchmark setup, the model relies on defensive assets performing well durin
equity downturns. But one can imagine a scenario, although not yet observed in the
backtest, where all defensive assets exhibit weak momentum and SPY is entering a
drawdown. In that case, the benchmark would still allocate fully to SPY, which could
very costly.
To address this, I rerun the model with an additional filter: SPY must also have a
momentum score above the risk-free rate to receive any fallback allocation. If not, t
fallback weight instead goes to cash, earning the risk-free rate.
The results show that this modification modestly reduces performance: The Sharpe
ratio declines to 0.97 and drawdowns tick higher. However, it adds a layer of
protection by ensuring the model never allocates to an asset with poor or negative

momentum. For more conservative investors, this may be a worthwhile trade-off,
offering additional peace of mind even at the cost of some performance.
If an investor is willing to take on some leverage through a triple-levered ETF, SPXL,
the model with a momentum filter on SPXL has offered a CAGR of about 20%, a
Sharpe of 1.13, and with a 23% drawdown, all beating SPY over time, as shown belo
under SPYfilter.

Conclusion and Investor Takeaway
Taken together, these robustness checks show that the tactical allocation model is n
fragile. Whether I vary the weighting scheme, exclude individual defensives, raise
transaction costs, shift thresholds, drop lookback windows, or require positive
momentum for the fallback equity sleeve, the broad picture is the same: Equity-like
returns with substantially smaller drawdowns. The nuances matter, equal-weighting
boosts Sharpe, gold and BTAL play unique hedging roles, and a SPY momentum filt
offers extra downside comfort at the cost of a somewhat lower Sharpe and higher
drawdowns, but none of these changes overturn the model’s core strengths.
Investor takeaway: This is a flexible, resilient framework rather than a parameter-
sensitive and data-mined model. Investors can adapt the specification to their own
preferences, whether prioritizing higher Sharpe, lower correlation to equities, or
stronger downside protection, while still retaining the core benefits of systematic
tactical allocation.
